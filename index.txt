About me

Hi! I'm Pranay, an ardent learner and Computer Science Engineering student at Delhi Technological University.

Whether it's mastering DSA with Java, diving into Machine Learning, building Full-Stack MERN web apps, or exploring System Design, I thrive on pushing boundaries.

An inherent characteristic of mine is a deep intolerance for stagnation. I actively seek out challenges to enhance my skills and practical knowledge. I'm driven to seek innovation and push for continual progress in everything I do.

Technical Proficiencies:

 - Core Programming Skills: Java, C++ , Python
 - Database Technologies: MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Neo4j
 - Machine Learning: Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow (Keras), OpenCV
 - Advanced AI Tools: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, GPT-Neo, StyleGAN
 - Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL

CS Fundamentals:

Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture and Organization, Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Database Management

Skills:

 - Technical Tools: MS Office (Intermediate) and Power BI
 - Soft Skills: Communication, Presentation, Negotiation, Critical Thinking, Time Management
 - Leadership & Collaboration: Project Management, Conflict Resolution, Strategic Planning

Beyond that, I'm an aesthete. When I’m not programming, you’ll find me immersed in philosophy, literature, music, or playing classics on the piano.
